## Overview

This is a tool which is intended for **simulator use only**. As of now, it can only provide landing distance calculation for Boeing 767-300, however in near future it will be extended with other aircraft types (Boeing 767-200, Boeing 777-200, Airbus A32X family and maybe more), live airport data load and others.

Now it is in an extremely early state, but already can be used for some flight-simming.

## Roadmap

For now, my plan on next features is:

- [improvement] allow to enter ICAO airport identifier (e.g. KSEA) and then select the runway in this airport. That will automatically download the METAR & LDA, heading, etc. In this case you don't need to enter all this manually.
- [new aircraft] Add capacity to calculate data for A321 & A321 Neo, as these 2 are my most popular planes to fly in X-Plane
